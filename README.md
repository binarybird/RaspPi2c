# RaspPi2c

I needed to connect multiple i2c sensors to my raspberry pi. So I got a TCA9548A multiplexer. There are not many good examples using the TCA9548A (and the connected i2c devices) on the raspi in python, so here this is.  
  
Supported devices are just the TCA9548A and the SHT20 at the moment. More are on the way.
